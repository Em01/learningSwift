* Think of a protocol as a contract

protocol changeCityDelegate {
  func userEnteredANewCityName(city: String)

}

* The above draws up the contract and says if you want to be the delegate then
you have to be able to implement the userEntered... method. So you have to be
able to handle what happens when the user uses this method & the method must be
within your class.

class ChangeCityViewController: UIViewController {

  var delegate : ChangeCityDelegate?
  //this means that the delegate can be set to ChangeCityDelegate but because it is an
  //optional if this is not the case then its value will be set to nil.

}
