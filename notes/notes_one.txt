IBOutlets: Used for referencing something that is on your storyboard

IBActions: Actions for when something happens

constants: defined by let

You don't explicitly have to define a data type to variables
Type annotation says the variable must be explicitly this type:
var myMessage : String


Integer:
Signed: Positive/Zero/Negative
Unsigned: Positive or Zero
default is signed
UInt: unsigned integer
Double is precision of at least 15 digits
Float is precision of 6

Type Safety: Swift is a type safe language, to use two different types
you would have to cast
e.g:
var myFloat: Float = 1.1
var myDouble: Double = 2.2
myDouble * Double(myDouble)

String Interpolation:
var myString = "Hello"
print("So \(myString)")
print("Again \(myString)")
