* Prevents null pointer error.
* It means it could contain a nil value

var example : String = "Hi"?

* When you use ! it means you are 100% sure that the property is not nill.
print(destination!)

* optional binding lets you check a value is not nil before it gets used in any line of code

if destination != nil {}
is the equivalent of setting a constant set the value of the optional
if let userSetDestination = destination
