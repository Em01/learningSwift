  VARIABLES:
  * var declares a variable
  * can be updated on the fly
  * mutable
  * Once you have assigned a value you the variable you cannot change the data type of it.

  CONSTANTS
  * defined by let
  * immutable - locked in value
  * use constants unless you know that the value needs to change

  STRINGS:
  * concatenation is done same as JS
  * interpolation: \(variable) -> "hello, \(name)" - allows you to mix in other types

  Numbers:
  * Integer for a whole number
  * Fractional numbers can be represented by either Double or Float.
  * Double is up to 15 digits
  * Float is up to 6 digits
  * Suggested to use Double unless you know you need to use float.
  * The different types has to do with the size of the number and how they are stored in memory

  Booleans:
