let locationManager = CLLocationManager()

func viewDidLoad() {
  locationManager.self = delegate
}


* conform to the delegate and then set ourselves as the delegate of the location manager
so that the location manager knows who to report to.
* Pattern allows us to use code written by apple

* You can stop the delegate manager receiving messages from the delegate:
mydelegateManager.delagte = nil
